- [Predicting Good Probabilities with Supervised Learning](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~alexn/papers/calibration.icml05.crc.rev3.pdf)
Paper by Alexandru Niculescu-Mizil and Rich Caruana from Cornell. 
Good overview of log-loss (the idea of mis-classifying labeled data).
  - [understanding-binary-cross-entropy-log-loss](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-binary-cross-entropy-log-loss-a-visual-explanation-a3ac6025181a)

- [A Mathematical Theory of Communications](http://math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf). Claude
Shannon's master work. Part 1: Discrete Noiseless Systems (first 18 pages) is quite tractable. Includes a
clear introduction to Markov Procceses.
  - [Andrew Ng's Notes on Markov decision processes](http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes/cs229-notes12.pdf) 
  - [Pavlov.js](https://github.com/NathanEpstein/Pavlov.js/) Pavlov.js uses Markov Decision Processes to implement reinforcement learning. It is written in C++ and compiled to JavaScript.

- [Predicting Good Probabilities With Supervised 
  Learning](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~alexn/papers/calibration.icml05.crc.rev3.pdf) 
  By Alexandru Niculescu-Mizil. "We examine the relationship between the predictions
  made by different learning algorithms and
  true posterior probabilities

  - [Comparison of Calibration of Classifiers](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/calibration/plot_compare_calibration.html#id2)
